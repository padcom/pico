        <h3>How I wrote my own version control system</h3>

<p>This is what happens when people have too much spare time traveling from home to work and back 6 hours a day... They create useless software that allows them to pass the time.</p>

<h3>The idea</h3>

<p>The idea was to create something that'll be astonishing, maybe not new but great in functionality and to do it in Groovy. I thought what the hell - why not write your own version control system :) Let's call it pico</p>

<h3>The credits</h3>

<p>The piece is 100% cloned in idea (and most of the solution as well) from The All Mighty And Only True Version control system - meaning Git.</p>

<h3>What's it doing?</h3>

<p>For now it is really simple: it can commit with a message (the user interface is sooooo cruel - need to work on it a bit), dump a sophisticated log and checkout the latest version. It's faaaaaaar from being complete and most probably it'll never get where Git is today but hey - that's what passing time means :D</p>

<p>But....</p>

<p>It does what it does and is written in Groovy! Granted that I can do better but trust me coming up with a working solution like that in less than 3 hours on a train was my point here - not the beautiful code :) The latter one is due some time in the future to fill the time...</p>

<h3>The code</h3>

<p>You can find the code as well as a batch file (yes, I am a Windows freak) here.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
