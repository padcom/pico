{"name":"Pico","body":"### How I wrote my own version control system\r\nThis is what happens when people have too much spare time traveling from home to work and back 6 hours a day... They create useless software that allows them to pass the time.\r\n\r\n### The idea\r\nThe idea was to create something that'll be astonishing, maybe not new but great in functionality and to do it in Groovy. I thought what the hell - why not write your own version control system :) Let's call it pico\r\n\r\n### The credits\r\nThe piece is 100% cloned in idea (and most of the solution as well) from The All Mighty And Only True Version control system - meaning Git.\r\n\r\n### What's it doing?\r\nFor now it is really simple: it can commit with a message (the user interface is sooooo cruel - need to work on it a bit), dump a sophisticated log and checkout the latest version. It's faaaaaaar from being complete and most probably it'll never get where Git is today but hey - that's what passing time means :D\r\n\r\nBut....\r\n\r\nIt does what it does and is written in Groovy! Granted that I can do better but trust me coming up with a working solution like that in less than 3 hours on a train was my point here - not the beautiful code :) The latter one is due some time in the future to fill the time...\r\n\r\n### The code\r\nYou can find the code as well as a batch file (yes, I am a Windows freak) here.\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n","tagline":"A small Git replacement in Groovy","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
